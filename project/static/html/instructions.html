			Welcome to Course Match, a platform allowing UNSW students to easily find and access courses that match those here at UNSW. 
			<br/><br/>
			We aim to invigorate the Exchange Process by empowering students with an easible accesible database of all matching or similar courses.
			<br/><br/>
			To use the website simply begin by adding courses from UNSW you would like to match, add any country preferences you may have, then add any university preferences you may have in those countries. 
			<br/><br/>
			Alternatively! If you only have one or a couple universities in mind, please feel free to immediately add those and ignore the country field! 
			<br/><br/>
			Once finished, please click generate and await while our system gathers your results for you!
			<br/><br/>
			From here, all you have to do is find the courses at the partner university you want to take! We have provided you a couple tools for this!
