			Welcome to Course Match, a platform allowing UNSW students to easily match courses for exchange. 
			<br/><br/>
			We empower students with an easily accesibly database of courses from UNSW's partner universities.
			<br/><br/>
			Begin by adding your courses from UNSW, add any country preferences you may have, then add any university preferences you may have in those countries. 
			<br/><br/>
			    If you already have a university in mind, feel free to ignore the country field.
			<br/><br/>
			Once finished, click generate and wait a few moments for our system to gather results.
			<br/><br/>
			From here, all you have to do is find the courses at the partner university you want to take. To assist, we have provided a couple of tools:
		</p>
		<div style="width: 50%; float: left; text-align: center">
			<img src="./../imgs/bars.png" class="instruction-img" />
	        AI-assisted calculation of similarity between the two courses
		</div>
		<div style="width: 50%; float: right; text-align: center">
			<img src="./../imgs/scales.png" class="instruction-img" />
		    A side-by-side comparison of both course outlines.
        </div>
		<p style="margin-top: 170px">We hope you find your match!</p>
